                I’m a self-taught front-end web developer and graphic designer. Always learning and looking for more opportunity to do so, I am open to freelance projects and full-time remote employment.

            <p>
                I aim to create websites that are functional, accessible, beautiful, and scalable. I love to find ways to incorporate subtle, fun details in my projects; finding the right placement for these details allows me to combine my passion for good design and code.
            </p>

                When not at the computer, I enjoy making things with my hands—whether it’s trying out a new recipe, a textile project, gardening, or tackling a home improvement venture.
